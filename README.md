# CTL(Computational Tree Logic) Model Checker

This is a simple CTL model checker implemented in Python. The repo consist of the following : 
* A CTL formula parser `parser.py`
* Yet Another CTL formula parser `converter.py` which generate AST where type nodes are only the temporal operators {EX, EG, EU}

Model Checker under construction

To make AST, run `run.py`
